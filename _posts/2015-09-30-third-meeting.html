title: Third Team Meeting

excerpt: The semester is in full swing, and we are progressing towards our new car!

<p>We're rolling, getting ready to start the build of our new car! Tonight we worked on a few tasks around (and outside of) the lab to prepare our selves.</p>

<p>Our first task was removing the ramp from the trailer. The ramp was where we parked the car in the trailer, and then strapped it down. The ramp however, would not have allowed us to transport the molds for the new car. They simply wouldn't fit inside of the trailer together.</p>

</ul>

<p>Next on our agenda was getting the 2010 car road ready. At our last meeting, we removed various suspension components, this was to get new team members familiar with one of the most imporant components of the car. We need to drive to an event this weekend, so the suspension will be nice to have!</p>

<p>Aside from that, the meeting consisted of team leads describing various parts of the car to new members, and Nick showing off our test vehicle.</p>

<p>That sums up our meeting. We just have to figure out what to do about our minions laying down on the job!</p>
