excerpt: After a five-year run with the previous solar car, the team is returning to the American Solar Challenge with an entirely new vehicle in 2016!
---
<p>We recently announced our intention to compete in the 2016 American Solar Challenge and Formula Sun Grand Prix, however we never said which vehicle we'd be taking. For the last five years, we've raced our <a href="{{ "/our-cars/2010" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2010 car</a>, it has performed well in its time, but we feel a new vehicle is in order.</p>

<p><a href="{{ "/our-cars/2016" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Sunseeker 2016</a> will be the culmination of a few year's work done by the team. One of the primary goals behind the design of the car is to meet the regulations of the World Solar Challenge, so that this car may one day compete in said event. We've also considered new regulations of the American Solar Challenge.</p>

<p>Some of the differences between this new vehicle and the retired 2010 car will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Four-wheel layout</li>
  <li>Rear-wheel drive</li>
  <li>Carbon fiber body</li>
  <li>Lithium ion batteries</li>
  <li>Aluminium rims designed and manufatured in-house</li>
  <li>Shorter in height and length, also wider</li>
  <li>Less weight</li>
  <li>Custom array, built in-house</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this list only covers some of the differences. Here are some rendering for you to see some of the differences yourself:</p>

  <li><img src="{{ "/images/blog/next-gen/right-front.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Right Front - Sunseeker 2016" /></li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you're as excited about this new car as we are, we will keep everyone up to date via our blog and social media as we progress through the build.
